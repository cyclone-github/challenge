Christmas is quickly approaching! As we did last year with our [Merry Christmas 2024 - hashpwn Wordlist Challenge](https://forum.hashpwn.net/post/246), hashpwn will be hosting another challenge, `The Twelve Days of Christmas Challenge - Double Time`, where we will be posting 12 challenges over the 6 days leading up to Christmas Day... so, *double time*! Also, in addition to releasing an updated hashpwn wordlist, we will also have daily prizes for participants to win.

---

### When:
* Start: December 20, 2025, 00:00 UTC
* End: December 25, 2025

### What:
* A series of daily hash cracking challenges, each designed to test your understanding of hashing algorithms, encoding, and most importantly, *critical thinking*. 

### Who:
* While this year's challenge will start off beginner friendly, users from all experience levels from newb to pro are encouraged to participate.
* Only the brightest critical thinkers will be able to complete the entire challenge.
* A modest GPU / CPU, experience with a few tools like hashcat, mdxfind, hashgen, cyberchef, and a smart brain are all that is needed to participate. 

### Challenges:
* Two challenges per day (12 challenges in total).
* Each challenge will include a small puzzle which should be solvable during your coffee break... how long of a coffee break depends on how well you're able to work through the puzzle. 
* Less experienced users will find some of these puzzles very difficult, while experienced users will find some of these puzzles very easy. 
* Every user, regardless of experience level, will likely get stumped at some point during the 12 challenges. This is expected and planned for.
* After the challenge has been posted, hints will later be posted for users who may be stuck. If you're still suck after reading the hint, go back and read through the previous challenges and any notes you made (take notes... you will need them).
* First to solve and submit the correct answer for that challenge will claim the prize for that challenge. All 12 challenges have prizes.
* The entire challenge is automated, so prize info will be immediately displayed to the winner for each challenge. 

### Prizes:
* Each challenge slot is sponsored by one or more of our community partners.
* The winner of each challenge will receive instructions for redeeming their prize(s).
* Make sure to copy these instructions as they will not be shown again!
* Prizes range from vouchers from our community sponsors to cash. 
* Rumor has it there will be a Grand Prize, so stay tuned for more info.
* A big thank you to this year's sponsors! (will be announced when the challenge starts)

### How to participate:
* Follow this page.
* Anyone may participate. 
* No signup / entry required.
* More info will be posted here a day or two before the challenge starts. 
* See you in a few weeks!
